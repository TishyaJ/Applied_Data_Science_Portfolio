## 1. Facebook Engagement Analysis 📈

**🎯 Objective:**  
Analyze Facebook post data to discover what factors drive higher user engagement.

**🛠️ Techniques Used:**
- Time-series analysis of post upload hour vs. engagement
- Correlation analysis between reactions, comments, and shares
- K-Means clustering for segmentation of posts

**📌 Key Findings:**
- Engagement peaks during **early afternoon hours**
- **Videos** receive the highest number of **comments and shares**
- Posts cluster into distinct categories like:
  - *Low engagement*
  - *High reaction*
  - *Viral share* posts

## 2. Advertising Sales Prediction 📺

**🎯 Objective:**  
Predict product sales based on advertising spend across TV, radio, and newspaper, and determine which channel contributes most to sales.

**🛠️ Techniques Used:**
- Correlation analysis between ad channels and sales
- **Linear Regression** model to predict sales
- Model evaluation and prediction on new data

**📌 Key Findings:**
- **TV advertising** has the strongest positive correlation with sales
- The regression model performs well in forecasting sales
- Excluding TV ad spend leads to a **significant drop** in model accuracy

## 3. Red Wine Quality Prediction 🍷

**🎯 Objective:**  
Use physicochemical properties of red wine to predict its quality rating.

**🛠️ Techniques Used:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on chemical features (e.g., alcohol, acidity)
- Trained two classifiers: **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**
- Compared model performance

**📌 Key Findings:**
- **Alcohol content** is the strongest positive predictor of quality
- **Volatile acidity** negatively impacts wine quality
- **Random Forest** significantly outperforms the Decision Tree model in prediction accuracy
